   Chapter 66: Self Actualization, Pt 1

   Hessitation iss alwayss eassy, rarely usseful.

   So the Defense Professor had told him; and while you could quibble
   about the details of the proverb, Harry understood the weaknesses of
   Ravenclaws well enough to know that you had to try answering your own
   quibbles. Did some plans call for waiting? Yes, many plans called for
   delayed action; but that was not the same as hesitating to choose. Not
   delaying because you knew the right moment to do what was necessary,
   but delaying because you couldn't make up your mind - there was no
   cunning plan which called for that.

   Did you sometimes need more information to choose? Yes, but that could
   also turn into an excuse for delaying; and it would be tempting to
   delay, when you were faced with a choice between two painful
   alternatives, and not choosing would avoid the mental pain for a time.
   So you would pick a piece of information you couldn't easily obtain,
   and claim that you couldn't possibly decide without it; that would be
   your excuse. Although if you knew what information you needed, knew
   when and how you would obtain that information, and knew what you would
   do depending on each possible observation, then that was less
   suspicious as an excuse for hesitating.

   If you weren't just hesitating, you ought to be able to choose in
   advance what you would do, once you had the extra information you
   claimed you needed.

   If the Dark Lord were really out there, would it be smart to go along
   with Professor Quirrell's plan to have someone impersonate the Dark
   Lord?

   No. Definitely no. Absolutely not.

   And if Harry knew for a fact that the Dark Lord wasn't really out
   there... in that case...

   The Defense Professor's office was a small room, at least today; it had
   changed since the last time Harry had seen it, the stone of the room
   becoming darker, more polished. Behind the Defense Professor's desk
   stood the single empty bookcase that always decorated the room, a tall
   bookcase stretching almost from the floor to the ceiling, with seven
   empty wooden shelves. Harry had only once seen Professor Quirrell take
   a book from those empty shelves, and never seen him put a book back.

   The green snake swayed above the seat of the chair behind the Defense
   Professor's desk, the lidless eyes staring unblinking at Harry from
   close to his own eye level.

   They were warded now by twenty-two spells, all that could be cast
   within Hogwarts without attracting the Headmaster's attention.

   "No," hissed Harry.

   The green snake cocked its head, tilting it slightly; no emotion was
   conveyed by the gesture, not that Harry's Parselmouth talent conveyed
   to him. "Reasson not?" said the green snake.

   "Too rissky," Harry said simply. That was true whether or not the Dark
   Lord was out there. Forcing himself to decide in advance had made him
   realize that he'd just been using the unanswered question as an excuse
   to hesitate; the sane decision was the same, either way.

   For a moment the dark pitted eyes seemed to gleam blackly, for a moment
   the scaled mouth gaped to expose the fangs. "Think you have learned
   wrong lessson, boy, from previouss failure. My planss are not in habit
   of failing, and lasst one would have gone flawlesssly, but for your own
   foolisshnesss. Correct lessson iss to follow ssteps laid down for you
   by older and wisser Sslytherin, tame your wild impulssess."

   "Lessson I learned is not to try plotss that would make girl-child
   friend think I am evil or boy-child friend think I am sstupid," Harry
   snapped back. He'd been planning a more temporizing response than that,
   but somehow the words had just slipped out.

   The sssss-ing sound that came from the snake was not heard by Harry as
   words, only as pure fury. A moment later, "You told them -"

   "Of coursse not! But know what they would ssay."

   There was a long pause as the snake-head swayed, staring at Harry;
   again no detectable emotion came through, and Harry wondered what
   Professor Quirrell could be thinking that would take Professor Quirrell
   that long to think.

   "You sserioussly care what thosse two think?" came the snake's final
   hiss. "True younglingss thosse two are, not like you. Could not weigh
   adult matterss."

   "Might have done better than me," Harry hissed. "Boy-child friend would
   have assked after ssecret motivess before asssenting to resscue woman
   -"

   "Glad you undersstand that now," the snake hissed coldly. "Alwayss assk
   after other'ss advantage. Next learn to alwayss assk after your own. If
   my plan iss not to your tasste, what iss yours?"

   "If necesssary - sstay at sschool ssix yearss and sstudy. Hogwartss
   sseemss fine place to dwell. Bookss, friendss, sstrange but tassty
   food." Harry wanted to chuckle, but there wasn't any gesture in
   Parseltongue for the kind of laughter he wanted to express.

   The pits of the snake's eyes seemed almost black. "Eassy to ssay that
   now. Ssuch as you and I, we do not tolerate imprissonment. You will
   losse patience long before sseventh year, perhapss before end of thiss
   one. I sshall plan accordingly."

   And before Harry could hiss another word of Parseltongue, the
   human-shape of Professor Quirrell was sitting in his chair once more.
   "So, Mr. Potter," said the Defense Professor, his voice as calm as if
   they had been discussing nothing important, as if the whole
   conversation had not occurred at all, "I hear that you have begun to
   practice dueling. Not the worthless sort with rules, I hope?"
     __________________________________________________________________

   Hannah Abbott looked as unnerved as Hermione had ever seen her (except
   on the day of the phoenix, the day Bellatrix Black had escaped, which
   shouldn't ought to count for anyone). The Hufflepuff girl had come over
   to the Ravenclaw table during dinner, and tapped Hermione on her
   shoulder, and very nearly dragged her away -

   "Neville and Harry Potter are learning dueling from Mr. Diggory!"
   Hannah blurted as soon as they were a few steps away from the table.

   "Who?" said Hermione.

   "Cedric Diggory!" said Hannah. "He's the Captain of our Quidditch Team,
   and general of an army, and he's taking all the electives and getting
   better grades than anyone, and I hear he learns dueling from
   professional tutors during the summers, and he once beat two
   seventh-year students, and even some teachers call him the Super
   Hufflepuff, and Professor Sprout says we should all emu, uh, emudate
   him or something like that, and -"

   After Hannah finally stopped for air (the list had gone on for a
   while), Hermione managed to insert a word in edgewise.

   "Sunshine Soldier Abbott!" said Hermione. "Calm down. We're not going
   to be fighting General Diggory, right? Sure, Neville's studying to beat
   us, but we can study too -"

   "Don't you see?" Hannah shrieked, raising her voice a lot louder then
   it should've been, if they were trying to keep the conversation private
   from all the Ravenclaws looking at them. "Neville isn't studying to
   beat us! He's practicing so he can fight Bellatrix Black! They're going
   to go through us like a Bludger through a stack of pancakes!"

   The Sunshine General gave her soldier a look. "Listen," said Hermione,
   "I don't think a few weeks of practice is going to make anyone an
   invincible fighter. Plus we already know how to handle invincible
   fighters. We'll concentrate fire on them and they'll go down just like
   Draco."

   The Hufflepuff girl was looking at her with mixed admiration and
   skepticism. "Aren't you even, you know, worried?"

   "Oh, honestly!" said Hermione. Sometimes it was hard being the only
   sensible person in your whole school year. "Haven't you ever heard the
   saying, the only thing we have to fear is fear itself?"

   "What?" said Hannah. "That's crazy, what about Lethifolds lurking in
   the darkness, and being put under the Imperius Curse, and horrible
   Transfiguration accidents and -"

   "I mean," said Hermione, exasperation leaking out into her now-raised
   voice, she'd been hearing this sort of thing all week now, "how about
   if we wait until after the Chaos Legion actually crushes us to get so
   scared of them and did you just mutter 'Gryffindors' under your voice?"

   A few moments later, Hermione was walking back to her place at the
   table with a sweet smile plastered onto her young face, it wasn't the
   terrible cold glare of Harry's dark side but it was the scariest face
   she knew how to make.

   Harry Potter was going down.

   "This is loony," gasped Neville, with what tiny amount of breath he
   could spare from being completely out of breath.

   "This is brilliant!" said Cedric Diggory. The eyes of the Super
   Hufflepuff gleamed with manic enthusiasm, shining like the sweat on his
   forehead as he stamped his feet through the dance of one of his dueling
   postures. His usually-light steps had changed to heavier stomps, which
   might have had something to do with the Transfigured metal weights
   they'd all attached to their arms and legs and strapped over their
   chests. "Where do you get these ideas, Mr. Potter?"

   "A strange old shop... in Oxford... and I'm never... shopping there...
   again." Thud.
