   Chapter 89: Time Pressure, Pt 2

   Cool blue fires clung to the floor in small masses, surrounding a
   blazing pool that seemed to burn with a deadlier, hotter blue.

   In one narrow circle the marble tiles were scorched and shattered by
   some explosive spell that only the most prodigious of first-year
   witches could have cast, with the last of her strength.

   On the terrace, still moving beneath the open sunlight, stood a great
   lumpy creature of dull granite-grey. Body like a boulder with small
   bald head perched on top like a stone, short legs thick as tree trunks
   with flat, horny feet. One hand held a tremendous stone club as long
   and as wide as an adult human, and the other hand held

   The Weasley twins screamed.

   Harry's Patronus shattered.

   The troll snorted and spun around to face them, dropping

   into the red pool that had spread out beneath its feet, raising its
   club high.

   Then a Weasley cried an incantation and the club was torn from the
   troll's hand, smashed into its face so hard it drove the troll back for
   one of its steps, a blow that might have killed a Muggle. The troll
   gave a bellow of anger, its nose squashed and blood-spattered, and then
   the nose straightened once more, regenerated. The troll grabbed with
   both hands for the club, which shot away through the air but only
   barely dodged the grab.

   "Lead it away, keep it off me," said a voice.

   The levitated club moved backwards from the troll, from the terrace
   onto the wide-open floor beneath the ceiling; and the troll made a
   great prodigious leap that almost brought the club into its hands. Then
   the troll made another great leap as the club moved to one side; and
   the broomstick moved forwards and Harry jumped off and ran towards
   where Hermione Granger was lying in a pool of her own blood with her
   legs eaten away to the upper thighs.

   Harry's hands tore open the healer's kit from his pouch, grabbed one of
   the self-tightening tourniquets, wrapped them around one ragged
   tooth-marked stump, his hands briefly slipping in the blood, they
   didn't tremble, there wasn't any allowance for his hands to tremble. As
   the tourniquet formed a complete loop it tightened hard and more blood
   came out, but then the bleeding stopped on that thigh-stump, and Harry
   turned to the other. Part of his mind was screaming, screaming,
   screaming and even the part of him picking up the other self-tightening
   tourniquet heard it, but that also wasn't allowed.

   The two Weasley twins were shouting spells, one after another in
   rapid-fire casting that would have had Harry unconscious in sixty
   seconds, sometimes the twins shouted two spells simultaneously in
   perfect coordination, but most of the spells were disrupting in
   harmless showers of sparks against the troll's skin. As the other
   tourniquet tightened itself in another pulse of blood, Harry looked up
   at a "Diffindo!" / "Reducto!" that made the troll's vulnerable eyes
   explode in twin showers of vitreous humor, but the troll only bellowed
   once more, its eyes already reforming.

   "Fire and acid!" Harry shouted. "Use fire or acid!"

   "Fuego!" / "Incendio!" Harry heard, but he wasn't looking, he was
   reaching for the syringe of glowing orange liquid that was the
   oxygenating potion, pushing it into Hermione's neck at what Harry hoped
   was the carotid artery, to keep her brain alive even if her lungs or
   heart stopped, so long as her brain stayed intact everything else could
   be fixed, it had to be possible for magic to fix it, it had to be
   possible for magic to fix it, it had to be possible for magic to fix
   it, and Harry pushed the plunger of the syringe all the way down,
   creating a faint glow beneath the pale skin of her neck. Harry then
   pushed down on her chest, where her heart should be, hard compressions
   that he hoped was moving the oxygenated blood around to where it could
   reach her brain, even if her heart might have stopped beating, he
   hadn't actually thought to check her pulse.

   Then Harry stared at the other things in his medical kit, his mind
   going blank as he tried to figure out what else of what was there, if
   anything, he could use. The screaming in that distant corner of his
   mind was getting louder, much louder, now that his hands had stopped
   their frantic motions. He was suddenly aware of the liquid sensation
   where blood had soaked through his robes and the knees of his pants.

   From behind Harry came the sound of another bellow from the troll, and
   he heard one of the Weasley twins shout "Deligitor prodeas!" and then,
   "HELP! Do something!"

   Harry twisted his head back to look, and saw that one of the Weasley
   twins was somehow now wearing the Sorting Hat on his head, facing off
   against the troll which held the huge stone club in both its hands,
   looking somewhat scorched now and with one or two smoking scars across
   its arms, but still intact.

   And then the voice of the Hat bellowed in a voice so loud it seemed to
   shake the walls,

   "GRYFFINDOR!"

   A pulse of power burned the air, magic feeling almost tangible even to
   Harry's young senses, the troll jumped back a pace with a snort of
   surprise. Fred or George, with a strange look on his face, swept the
   Hat off his head with a motion smooth as a magician's trick, and
   reached in with one hand and drew forth a hilt whose pommel was a
   glowing ruby, followed by a wide crossguard of gleaming white metal,
   and a blade as long as a tall child. As the sword was revealed the air
   seemed to fill with a silent scream of fury.

   Upon the blade was written in golden script, nihil supernum.

   Then the Weasley twin raised the sword aloft as though the huge blade
   weighed nothing, and screamed and charged.

   Harry's lips opened to say something, some long sentence like, No,
   stop, you have no idea how to use a sword but not even a single
   syllable left his lips before the sword sliced off the troll's right
   arm through the elbow, cutting through skin and flesh and bone like
   jelly; just as the already-swinging arc of the stone club smashed into
   the charging Weasley twin and sent him flying through the air above the
   marble floor, over the gap out of which they'd risen on the broomstick,
   until that Weasley hit the wall on the opposite side and then collapsed
   into an unmoving heap.

   The bright sword vanished down into the opening in the floor,
   clattering distantly as it dropped.

   "Fred!" screamed George Weasley, and then "VENTUS!"

   An invisible blow caught the troll and hurled it sideways through the
   air.

   "VENTUS!"

   The troll was hit again, blown to the edge of the floor and the gap
   leading downwards.

   "VENTUS!"

   But the troll had reached down and grabbed at the floor, its remaining
   hand crunching through marble to gain a firm hold. The third blow sent
   the troll's body over the gap; but the hand remained at the edge. And
   then the troll was pulling itself back up single-handedly, roaring.

   George Weasley staggered, almost falling, his hand dropping to his
   side. "Harry -" the Weasley twin said in a strained voice, "Run -"

   The remaining Weasley twin took a step sideways, slumped against the
   wall, and slid to the ground.

   Time was fractured in Harry's mind, the world around him seemed to move
   slowly, distorted, or perhaps it was his own mind twisting and folding.
   He should have been moving, doing something, but a strange paralysis
   seemed to be stopping all his muscles, all his motions. Without any
   time for words, thoughts came in flashes of concepts: that if Harry ran
   away the troll would eat the Weasley twins as well as Hermione, that if
   Bludgers didn't kill wizards then Fred should still be alive, that the
   Weasley twins were more powerful spellcasters than him and they hadn't
   been able to hold back the troll, there was no time to Transfigure
   anything he didn't already possess, the troll seemed too agile to be
   lured over the edge of the terrace to fall off the sides of the
   Hogwarts castle, someone had enchanted the troll against sunlight
   before using it as a murder weapon and might also have strengthened it
   in other ways. And then a mental image of Hermione running from the
   troll, running for sunlight, finally reaching the bright terrace with
   the troll hot on her heels, only to find that someone else had thought
   of that possibility, too.

   The screaming horror in his mind was drowned out by another emotion.

   Harry stood up.

   On the other side of the room, the enemy had also risen, the
   unregenerating stump of one sword-cut arm still bloody.

   intent to kill

   The troll grasped its fallen club in its remaining hand, and gave a
   huge bellow, smashing the club into the floor and sending marble chips
   flying.

   think purely of killing

   The troll began to lumber towards where George had fallen, a thin
   string of drool trailing from the side of its lips.

   grasp at any means to do so

   Harry took five strides forward, and the enemy gave another bellow and
   turned away from George, its eyes focusing squarely on him.

   censors off, do not flinch

   The third most perfect killing machine in nature bounded towards him in
   leaping steps.

   KILL

   Harry's left hand already held the Transfigured diamond from his ring,
   his right hand already held his wand.

   "Wingardium Leviosa."

   Harry's wand directed the tiny jewel into the troll's mouth.

   "Finite Incantatem."

   The troll's head blew off its spine as the rock expanded back into its
   old form, and Harry stepped aside as the Enemy's body crashed where
   he'd been standing.

   The enemy's head was already beginning to regenerate, the ragged stump
   of the jaw and spine smoothing over, the mouth completing itself and
   replacing its teeth.

   Harry bent down and picked up the troll's head by its left ear. His
   wand jammed through the troll's left eye, plunging through the
   jelly-like material and passing through the wide socket in the bone.
   Harry visualized a one-millimeter-wide cross-section through the
   enemy's brain, and Transfigured it into sulfuric acid.

   The enemy stopped regenerating.

   Harry threw the corpse over the edge of the terrace and turned back to
   Hermione.

   Her eyes were moving, and focused on him.

   Harry scrambled down beside her, ignoring the blood soaking more of his
   already-soaked robes. You'll be all right, his brain formed the
   sentence, but his lips wouldn't move. You'll be all right, we'll find
   some magic to fix all this, put you back to normal, just hold on, don't
   -

   Hermione's lips were moving, just a tiny bit but they were moving.

   "your... fault..."

   Time froze. Harry should have told her not to talk, to save her breath,
   only he couldn't unblock his lips.

   Hermione drew in another breath, and her lips whispered, "Not your
   fault."

   Then she exhaled, and closed her eyes.

   Harry stared at her with his mouth half-open, his breath caught in his
   throat.

   "Don't do this," said his voice. He'd only been two minutes late.

   Hermione suddenly convulsed, her arms twitching into the air as though
   reaching up for something, and her eyes flew open again. There was a
   burst of something that was magic and also more, a shout louder than an
   earthquake and containing a thousand books, a thousand libraries, all
   spoken in a single cry that was Hermione; too vast to be understood,
   except that Harry suddenly knew that Hermione had whited out the pain,
   and was glad not to be dying alone. For a moment it seemed like the
   outpouring of magic might hold, take root in the castle's stone; but
   then the outpouring ended and the magic faded, her body stopped moving
   and all motion halted as Hermione Jean Granger ceased to exist -

   No.

   Harry stood up from the body, swaying.

   No.

   There was a burst of flame and Dumbledore was standing there with
   Fawkes, his eyes filled with horror. "I felt a student die! What -"

   The old wizard's eyes saw what lay upon the ground.

   "Oh, no," whispered Albus Dumbledore. Fawkes gave a sad, mournful
   croon.

   "Bring her back."

   There was silence on the terrace. Fred Weasley had risen up into the
   air at a gesture from Dumbledore's wand and was floating towards them,
   surrounded by a reassuring pink glow.

   "Harry -" the old wizard began. His voice cracked. "Harry -"

   "Have Fawkes cry on her or whatever. Hurry up." The voice that spoke
   sounded perfectly calm.

   "I, I can't, Harry, it's too late, she's dead -"

   "I don't want to hear about it. If it was me lying there, you'd pull
   some kind of amazing rabbit out of your hat and save me, right, because
   the hero isn't allowed to die before the story's over. Well, she's the
   hero too, so whatever you were saving for that extra-special occasion,
   just go ahead and use it now. I promise I'll pay you back."

   "There isn't anything I can do! Her soul has departed, she's passed
   on!"

   Harry opened his mouth to scream out all his fury, and then closed it
   again. There wasn't any point in screaming, it wouldn't accomplish
   anything. The unbearable pressure rising inside him couldn't be let out
   that way.

   Harry turned away from Dumbledore and looked down at where the remains
   of Hermione Granger were lying in a pool of blood. Part of his mind was
   hammering at the world around him, trying to make it go away, wake up
   from the nightmare and find himself back in his Ravenclaw dorm room
   with the morning sun shining through the curtains. But the blood
   remained and Harry didn't wake up, and another part of him already knew
   that this event was real, part of the same flawed world that included
   Azkaban and the Wizengamot chamber and

   No

   With a fracturing feeling, as though time was still torn to pieces
   around him, Harry turned away from Dumbledore and looked down at the
   remains of Hermione Granger lying in a pool of blood with two
   tourniquets tied around her thigh-stumps, and decided

   No.

   I do not accept this.

   There isn't any reason to accept it, not when there's magic in the
   world.

   Harry would learn whatever he had to learn, invent whatever he had to
   invent, rip the knowledge of Salazar Slytherin from the Dark Lord's
   mind, discover the secret of Atlantis, open any gates or break any
   seals necessary, find his way to the root of all magic and reprogram
   it.

   He would rip apart the foundations of reality itself to get Hermione
   Granger back.
     __________________________________________________________________

   "The crisis is over," the Defense Professor said. "You may dismount,
   Madam."

   Trelawney, who had been sitting behind him on the two-person broomstick
   that had just blazed through Hogwarts burning directly through all the
   walls and floors in their way, hastily pulled herself off and then sat
   down hard on the floor, a pace away from the red-glowing edges of a
   newly made gap in the wall. The woman was still breathing in gasps,
   bending over herself as though she were on the verge of vomiting out
   something larger than she was.

   The Defense Professor had felt the boy's horror, through the link that
   existed between the two of them, the resonance in their magic; and he
   had realized that the boy had sought the troll and found it. The
   Defense Professor had tried to send an impulse to retreat, to don the
   Cloak of Invisibility and flee; but he'd never been able to influence
   the boy through the resonance, and hadn't succeeded that time either.

   He'd felt the boy give himself over fully to the killing intention.
   That was when the Defense Professor had begun burning through the
   substance of Hogwarts, trying to reach the battle in time.

   He'd felt the boy exterminate his enemy in seconds.

   He'd felt the boy's dismay as one of his friends died.

   He'd felt the fury the boy had directed at some annoyance who was
   likely Dumbledore; followed by an unknown resolution whose unyielding
   hardness even he found adequate. With any luck, the boy had just
   discarded his foolish little reluctances.

   Unseen by anyone, the Defense Professor's lips curved up in a thin
   smile. Despite its little ups and downs, on the whole this had been a
   surprisingly good day -

   "HE IS HERE. THE ONE WHO WILL TEAR APART THE VERY STARS IN HEAVEN. HE
   IS HERE. HE IS THE END OF THE WORLD."
