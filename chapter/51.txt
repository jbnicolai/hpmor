   Chapter 51: Title Redacted, Pt 1

   Saturday.

   Harry had run into trouble falling asleep Friday night, which he had
   anticipated might happen, and so he had decided to take the obvious
   advance precaution of buying a sleeping potion; and to prevent it from
   constituting a visible sign that he was nervous, he had decided to buy
   it off Fred and George a couple of months earlier. (Be prepared, that's
   the Boy Scout's marching song...)

   Thus Harry was fully rested, and his pouch contained almost everything
   which he owned and might conceivably need. Harry had, in fact, run into
   the volume limitation on the pouch; and keeping in mind that he would
   need to store a large snake, and might need to store
   who-knew-what-else, he had removed some of the bulkier items, like the
   car battery. He was up to the point now where he could Transfigure
   something the size of a car battery in four minutes flat, so it wasn't
   much of a loss.

   Harry had kept the emergency flares and the oxyacetylene welding torch
   and fuel tank, since you couldn't just Transfigure things that were to
   be burned.

   (Be prepared, as through life you march along...)

   Mary's Place.

   After the waitress had taken their order and bowed to them and left the
   room, Professor Quirrell had performed only four Charms, and then
   they'd talked about nothing of any vast consequence, just Professor
   Quirrell's complex thesis about how the Dark Lord's curse on the
   Defense position had led to the decline of dueling and how this had
   changed social customs in magical Britain. Harry listened and nodded
   and said intelligent things, while he tried to control the pounding of
   his heart.

   Then the waitress came in again bearing their food, and this time, a
   minute after the waitress had departed, Professor Quirrell gestured for
   the door to close and lock, and began to speak twenty-nine security
   Charms, one of the ones in Mr. Bester's sequence being left out this
   time, which somewhat puzzled Harry.

   Professor Quirrell finished his Charms -

   - stood up from his chair -

   - blurred into a green snake, banded in blue and white -

   - hissed, "Hungry, boy? Eat your fill sswiftly, we sshall need both
   sstrength and time."

   Harry's eyes were a bit wide, but he hissed, "I ate well at
   breakfasst," and then rapidly began forking noodles into his mouth.

   The snake watched him for a moment, with those flat eyes, and then
   hissed, "Do not wissh to explain here. Prefer to be elssewhere firsst.
   Need to leave unobsserved, without ssign we have ever departed room."

   "Sso no one can track uss," hissed Harry.

   "Yess. Do you trusst me that much, boy? Think before ansswer. I will
   have important requesst of you, which requiress trusst; if ssay no
   regardlesss, then ssay no now."

   Harry dropped his gaze from the snake's flat eyes, and looked back down
   at his sauce-coated noodles, and ate another bite, then another, while
   he thought.

   The Defense Professor... was an ambiguous figure, to put it mildly;
   Harry thought he had unraveled some of his goals, but others remained
   mysterious.

   But Professor Quirrell had knocked down two hundred girls to stop the
   ones summoning Harry. Professor Quirrell had deduced that the Dementor
   was draining Harry through his wand. The Defense Professor had saved
   Harry's life, twice, in a two-week period.

   Which could mean that the Defense Professor was just saving Harry for
   later, that there were ulterior motives. Indeed, it was certain that
   there were ulterior motives. Professor Quirrell wasn't doing this on a
   whim. But then Professor Quirrell had also seen Harry taught
   Occlumency, he had taught Harry how to lose... if the Defense Professor
   wanted to make some use of Harry Potter, it was a use that required a
   strengthened Harry Potter, not a weakened one. That was what it meant
   to be used by a friend, that they would want the use to make you
   stronger instead of weaker.

   And if there was sometimes a cold atmosphere about the Defense
   Professor, bitterness in his voice or emptiness in his gaze, then Harry
   was the only one who Professor Quirrell allowed to see it.

   Harry didn't quite know how to describe in words the sense of kinship
   he felt with Professor Quirrell, except to say that the Defense
   Professor was the only clear-thinking person Harry had met in the
   wizarding world. Sooner or later everyone else started playing
   Quidditch, or not putting protective shells on their time machines, or
   thinking that Death was their friend. It didn't matter how good their
   intentions were. Sooner or later, and usually sooner, they demonstrated
   that something deep inside their brain was confused. Everyone except
   Professor Quirrell. It was a bond that went beyond anything of debts
   owed, or even anything of personal liking, that the two of them were
   alone in the wizarding world. And if the Defense Professor occasionally
   seemed a little scary or a little Dark, well, that was just the same
   thing some people said about Harry.

   "I trusst you," hissed Harry.

   And the snake explained the first stage of the plan.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Harry took a final forkful of noodles, chewed. Beside him, Professor
   Quirrell, now in human form again, was eating his soup placidly, as
   though nothing of special interest were occurring.

   Then Harry swallowed, and in the same moment stood up from his chair,
   already feeling his heart start to hammer hard in his chest. The
   security precautions they were taking were literally the most stringent
   possible...

   "Are you ready to test it, Mr. Potter?" Professor Quirrell said calmly.

   It wasn't a test, but Professor Quirrell wouldn't say that, not out
   loud in human speech, even in this room screened to the limit that
   Professor Quirrell had secured with further Charms.

   "Yep," Harry said as casually as he could.

   Step one.

   Harry said "Cloak" to his pouch, drew forth the Cloak of Invisibility,
   and then unstuck the pouch from his belt and threw it toward the other
   side of the table.

   The Defense Professor stood up from his own seat, drew his wand, bent
   down, and touched his wand to the pouch, murmuring a quiet incantation.
   The new enchantments would ensure that Professor Quirrell could enter
   the pouch on his own in snakeform, and leave it on his own, and hear
   what went on outside while he was in the pouch.

   Step two.

   As Professor Quirrell stood up from where he'd bent over by the pouch,
   and put away his wand, his wand happened to point in Harry's direction,
   and there was a brief crawling sensation on Harry's chest near where
   the Time-Turner lay, like something creepy had passed very close by
   without touching him.

   Step three.

   The Defense Professor turned into a snake again, and the sense of doom
   diminished; the snake crawled to the pouch and into it, the pouch's
   mouth opening to admit the green shape, and as the mouth closed again
   behind the tail, the sense of doom diminished further.

   Step four.

   Harry drew his wand, being careful to stand still as he did it, so that
   the Time-Turner would not move from where Professor Quirrell had
   anchored the hourglass within the shell in its current orientation.
   "Wingardium Leviosa," murmured Harry, and the pouch began to float
   toward him.

   Slowly, slowly, as Professor Quirrell had instructed, the pouch began
   to float toward Harry, who waited alert for any sign the pouch was
   opening, in which case Harry was to use the Hover Charm to propel it
   away from him as fast as possible.

   As the pouch came within a meter of Harry, the sense of doom returned.

   As Harry reattached the pouch to his belt, the sense of doom was
   stronger than it had ever been, but still not overwhelming; it was
   tolerable.

   Even with Professor Quirrell's Animagus form lying within the extended
   space of the pouch resting on Harry's very hip.

   Step five.

   Harry sheathed his wand. His other hand still held the Cloak of
   Invisibility, and Harry drew that cloak over himself.

   Step six.

   And so in that room shielded from every possible scrying, which
   Professor Quirrell had personally and further secured, it was not until
   after Harry was wearing the true Cloak of Invisibility that he reached
   beneath his shirt and twisted the outer shell of the Time-Turner just
   once.

   The Time-Turner's inner hourglass stayed anchored and motionless, the
   setting twisted around it -

   The food vanished from the table, the chairs leaped back into place,
   the door sprang open.

   Mary's Room was deserted, as it should have been, because Professor
   Quirrell had earlier contacted Mary's Place under a false name to
   inquire whether the room would be available at this hour - not to
   reserve it, not to place a canceled reservation that might be noted,
   but only to inquire.

   Step seven.

   Staying under the Cloak of Invisibility, Harry left through the open
   door. He navigated the tiled hallways of Mary's Place to the
   well-stocked bar that greeted new entrants, tended by the owner, Jake.
   There were only a few people at the bar, in the morning before proper
   lunchtime, and Harry had to wait invisibly by the door for several
   minutes, listening to the murmur of conversation and the gurgle of
   alcohol, before the door opened to admit a huge genial Irishman, and
   Harry slipped out silently in his wake.

   Step eight.

   Harry walked for a while. He was well away from Mary's Place when he
   turned off Diagon Alley into a smaller alley, at the end of which lay a
   shop that was dark, the windows enchanted to blackness.

   Step nine.

   "Sword fish melon friend," Harry spoke the passphrase to the lock, and
   it clicked open.

   Within the shop was also darkness, the light from the open door briefly
   illuminating it to show a wide, empty room. The furniture shop which
   had once operated here had gone bankrupt a few months ago, according to
   the Defense Professor, and the shop had been repossessed, but not yet
   resold. The walls were painted a simple white, the wooden floor
   scratched and unpolished, a single closed door set in the back wall;
   this had been a showroom, once, but now it showed nothing.

   The door clicked shut behind Harry, and then the darkness was pitch and
   complete.

   Step ten.

   Harry took out his wand and said "Lumos", lighting the room with white
   glow; he took his pouch from his belt (the sense of doom growing a
   little sharper as he grasped it with his fingers) and lightly tossed it
   to the opposite side of the room (the sense of doom fading almost
   completely). And then he began to take off the Cloak of Invisibility,
   even as his voice hissed, "It iss done."

   Step eleven.

   From the pouch poked a green head, followed shortly by a meter-long
   green body as the snake slithered out. A moment later, the snake
   blurred into Professor Quirrell.

   Step twelve.

   Harry waited in silence while the Defense Professor recited thirty
   Charms.

   "All right," Professor Quirrell said calmly, when he had finished. "If
   anyone is still watching us now, we are in any case doomed, so I will
   speak plainly and in human form. Parseltongue does not quite suit me, I
   fear, as I am neither a descendant of Salazar nor a true snake."

   Harry nodded.

   "So, Mr. Potter," said Professor Quirrell. His gaze intent, his pale
   blue eyes dark and shadowed in the white light coming from Harry's
   wand. "We are alone and unobserved, and I have an important question to
   ask you."

   "Go ahead," said Harry, his heart starting to beat faster.

   "What is your opinion of the government of magical Britain?"

   That wasn't quite what Harry had been expecting, but it was close
   enough, so Harry said, "Based on my limited knowledge, I would say that
   both the Ministry and the Wizengamot appear to be stupid, corrupt, and
   evil."

   "Correct," Professor Quirrell said. "Do you understand why I ask?"

   Harry took a deep breath, and looked Professor Quirrell straight in the
   eyes, unflinching. Harry had finally worked out that the way to make
   amazing deductions from scanty evidence was to know the answer in
   advance, and he had guessed this answer fully a week ago. It needed
   only a slight adjustment...

   "You are about to invite me to join a secret organization full of
   interesting people like yourself," said Harry, "one of whose goals is
   to reform or overthrow the government of magical Britain, and yes, I'm
   in."

   There was a slight pause.

   "I'm afraid that is not quite where I intended to direct this
   conversation," said Professor Quirrell. The corners of his lips were
   twitching slightly. "I merely planned to ask for your help in doing
   something extremely treasonous and illegal."

   Darn, thought Harry. Still, Professor Quirrell hadn't denied it... "Go
   on."

   "Before I do," said Professor Quirrell. There was no levity in his
   voice, now. "Are you open to such requests, Mr. Potter? I say again
   that if you are likely to say no regardless, you must say no now. If
   your curiosity impels you otherwise, squash it."

   "Treasonous and illegal doesn't bother me," said Harry. "Risks bother
   me and the stakes would need to be commensurate, but I can't imagine
   you taking risks frivolously."

   Professor Quirrell nodded. "I would not. It is a terrible abuse of my
   friendship with you, and of such trust as is placed in my teaching
   position at Hogwarts -"

   "You can skip this part," Harry said.

   The lips twitched again, and then went flat. "Then I shall skip it. Mr.
   Potter, you sometimes make a game of lying with truths, playing with
   words to conceal your meanings in plain sight. I, too, have been known
   to find that amusing. But if I so much as tell you what I hope we shall
   do this day, Mr. Potter, you will lie about it. You will lie straight
   out, without hesitation, without wordplay or hints, to anyone who asks
   about it, be they foe or closest friend. You will lie to Malfoy, to
   Granger, and to McGonagall. You will speak, always and without
   hesitation, in exactly the fashion you would speak if you knew nothing,
   with no concern for your honor. That also is how it must be."

   There was silence, then, for a time.

   That was a price measured in a fraction of Harry's soul.

   "Without telling me yet..." said Harry. "Can you say if the need is
   desperate?"

   "There is someone in the most terrible want of your help," Professor
   Quirrell said simply, "and there is no one who can help them but you."

   There was another silence, but not a long one.

   "All right," Harry said quietly. "Tell me of the mission."

   The dark robes of the Defense Professor seemed to blur against the
   shadow on the wall, cast by his silhouette blocking the white light of
   Harry's wand. "The ordinary Patronus Charm, Mr. Potter, wards off a
   Dementor's fear. But the Dementors still see you through it, they know
   that you are there. Only not your Patronus Charm. It blinds them, or
   more than blinds them. What I saw beneath the cloak wasn't even looking
   in our direction as you killed it; as though it had forgotten our
   existence, even as it died."

   Harry nodded. That wasn't surprising, not when you confronted a
   Dementor on the level of its true existence, beyond anthropomorphism.
   Death might be the last enemy, but it wasn't a sentient enemy. When
   humanity had wiped out smallpox, smallpox hadn't fought back.

   "Mr. Potter, the central branch of Gringotts is guarded by every spell
   high and low that the goblins know. Even so those vaults have been
   successfully robbed; for what wizardry can do, wizardry can undo. And
   yet no one has ever escaped from Azkaban. No one. For every Charm there
   is a counter-Charm, for every ward there is a bypass. How can it be
   that no one has ever been rescued from Azkaban?"

   "Because Azkaban has something invincible," Harry said. "Something so
   terrible that no one can defeat it."

   That was the keystone of their perfect security, it had to be, nothing
   human. It was Death that guarded Azkaban.

   "The Dementors don't like their meals being taken away from them,"
   Professor Quirrell said. Coldness had entered that voice, now. "They
   know if anyone tries. There are more than a hundred Dementors there,
   and they speak to the guards as well. It's that simple, Mr. Potter. If
   you're a powerful wizard then Azkaban isn't hard to enter, and it isn't
   hard to leave. So long as you don't try to take anything out of it that
   belongs to the Dementors."

   "But the Dementors are not invincible," said Harry. He could have cast
   the Patronus Charm with that thought, in that very moment. "Never
   believe that they are."

   Professor Quirrell's voice was very quiet. "Do you remember what it was
   like when you went before the Dementor, the first time, when you
   failed?"

   "I remember."

   And then with a sudden sickening lurch in his stomach, Harry knew where
   this was going; he should have seen it before.

   "There is an innocent person in Azkaban," Professor Quirrell said.

   Harry nodded, there was a burning sensation in his throat, but he
   didn't cry.

   "The one of whom I speak was not under the Imperius Curse," said the
   Defense Professor, dark robes silhouetted against a greater shadow.
   "There are surer ways to break wills than the Imperius, if you have the
   time for torture, and Legilimency, and rituals of which I will not
   speak. I cannot tell you how I know this, how I know any of this,
   cannot hint at it even to you, you will have to trust me. But there is
   a person in Azkaban who never once chose to serve the Dark Lord, who
   has spent years suffering alone in the most terrible cold and darkness
   imaginable, and never deserved a single minute of it."

   Harry saw it in a single leap of intuition, his mouth racing almost
   ahead of his thoughts.

   There was no hint, no warning, we all thought -

   "A person by the name of Black," Harry said.

   There was silence. Silence, while the pale blue eyes stared at him.

   "Well," said Professor Quirrell after a while. "So much for not telling
   you the name until after you had accepted the mission. I would ask
   whether you're reading my mind, but that's flatly impossible."

   Harry said nothing, but it was simple enough if you believed in the
   processes of modern democracy. The most obvious person in Azkaban to be
   innocent was the one who hadn't gotten a trial -

   "I am certainly impressed, Mr. Potter," said Professor Quirrell. His
   face was grave. "But this is a serious matter, and if there is some way
   others could make the same deduction, I must know. So tell me, Mr.
   Potter. How in the name of Merlin, of Atlantis, and the void between
   the stars, did you guess that I was talking about Bellatrix?"
