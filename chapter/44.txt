   Chapter 44: Humanism, Pt 2

   "Fawkes," said Albus Dumbledore, his voice cracking, "help him, please
   -"

   A brilliant creature of red-gold shuffled into the field of vision,
   looking down quizzically; and it began to croon.

   The meaningless chirps slid off the emptiness, there was nothing onto
   which they could hold.

   "You're noisy," said the voice, "you should die."

   "Chocolate," Albus Dumbledore said, "you need chocolate, and your
   friends - but I dare not take you back -"

   Then a shining raven came, and spoke in Professor Flitwick's voice;
   whereupon Albus Dumbledore gasped in sudden comprehension, and cursed
   aloud at his own stupidity.

   The empty thing laughed at that, for it had retained the capacity to be
   amused.

   And a moment later they had all vanished in another flash of fire.
     __________________________________________________________________

   It was only a moment, it seemed, between when Flitwick's raven had
   flown to elsewhere, and when Albus Dumbledore reappeared in another
   crack of red and golden fire with Harry in his arms; but somehow in
   that time Hermione had already managed to fill her hands with
   chocolate.

   Before Hermione even got there, chocolate had zoomed off the table and
   straight into Harry's mouth, which a tiny part of her mind said was
   unfair, he'd gotten a chance to do it for her -

   Harry spat the chocolate back out again.

   "Go away," said a voice so empty it wasn't even cold.

   ...

   Everything seemed to freeze, everyone who had been moving toward Harry
   halted, all movements broken by the shock of those two dead words.

   Then: "No," said Albus Dumbledore, "I will not," and time resumed
   again, even as another piece of chocolate zoomed off the table and into
   Harry's mouth.

   Hermione was close enough now that she could see Harry's expression
   become more hateful, as his mouth chewed with a mechanical, unnatural
   rhythm.

   The Headmaster's voice was grim as iron. "Filius, call Minerva, tell
   her she must come at speed."

   Professor Flitwick whispered to his silver raven, and it flew into the
   air and vanished.

   Another piece of chocolate floated into Harry's mouth, and the
   mechanical chewing continued.

   There were more students gathering around where the Headmaster watched
   over Harry with grim eyes: Neville, Seamus, Dean, Lavender, Ernie,
   Terry, Anthony, none of them daring to approach any closer than
   Hermione had.

   "What can we do?" said Dean in a trembling voice.

   "Back off and give him more space -" said the dry voice of Professor
   Quirrell.

   "No!" interrupted the Headmaster. "Let him be surrounded by his
   friends."

   Harry swallowed his chocolate, and said in that empty voice, "They're
   stupid. They should diemmmppphhh" as another piece of chocolate entered
   his mouth.

   Hermione saw the looks of shock that crossed their faces.

   "He doesn't mean it, does he?" Seamus said it like he was begging.

   "You don't understand," Hermione said, her voice breaking, "that's not
   Harry -" and she shut up before she said anything more, but she had to
   say that much.

   She saw from the look on his face that Neville understood, and she also
   saw that the others didn't. If Harry had really never thought anything
   like that, then being exposed to a Dementor for less than a minute
   wouldn't have made him say it. That's what they were probably thinking.

   Less than a minute of Dementor exposure couldn't create a whole new
   evil person inside you out of nothing.

   But if that person was already there -

   Does the Headmaster know?

   Hermione looked up at the Headmaster, and found that Albus Dumbledore
   was gazing at her, and that his blue eyes had grown suddenly piercing -

   Words came into her mind.

   Do not speak of it, said the will of Dumbledore to her.

   You know, thought Hermione. About his dark side.

   I know. But this is beyond even that. Fawkes's song cannot reach him,
   where he is lost.

   What can we -

   I have a plan, sent the Headmaster. Patience.

   Something about the tenor of that thought made Hermione nervous. What
   sort of plan?

   It is better that you not know, sent the Headmaster.

   Now Hermione was getting really nervous. She didn't know how much the
   Headmaster knew about Harry's dark side -

   A fair point, sent the Headmaster. I am about to tell you; steel
   yourself so as not to react. Are you ready? Good. I am going to pretend
   to cast the Killing Curse on Professor McGonagall - DO NOT REACT,
   Hermione!

   That took work. The Headmaster really was crazy! That wouldn't bring
   Harry out of his dark side, Harry would go completely berserk, he'd
   kill the Headmaster -

   But that is not true darkness, sent Albus Dumbledore. That is
   protectiveness, that is love. Fawkes will be able to reach him, then.
   And when Harry sees that Minerva is alive after all, it will return him
   fully.

   The thought came to Hermione -

   I doubt that will work, sent the Headmaster, and you may not like the
   way he reacts if you try. But you may try if you wish.

   She hadn't really meant that seriously! It was too -

   Then her eyes moved, breaking gaze with the Headmaster, going to the
   boy looking around with empty, despising eyes as his mouth kept chewing
   and swallowing bar after bar of chocolate without effect. Her heart
   wrenched, and suddenly a lot of things didn't seem to matter, only that
   there was a chance.
     __________________________________________________________________

   There was a compulsion to chew and swallow chocolate. The response to
   compulsion was killing.

   People had gathered around and stared. That was annoying. The response
   to annoyance was killing.

   Other people were chattering in the background. That was insolent. The
   response to insolence was to inflict pain, but since none of them were
   useful, killing them would be simpler.

   Killing all those people would be difficult. But many of them didn't
   trust Quirrell, who was strong. Finding exactly the right trigger could
   cause them all to kill each other.

   Then a person leaned over into the field of vision and did something
   completely strange, something that belonged to a foreign mode of
   thought, for which there was only a single response stored anywhere -
     __________________________________________________________________

   She heard the gasps around her, and they didn't matter, she maintained
   the kiss on those chocolate-smeared lips as the tears welled in her
   eyes.

   And Harry's arms came up and pushed her away, and his lips yelled, "I
   told you, no kissing!"
     __________________________________________________________________

   "I think he'll be all right now," the Headmaster said, looking at where
   Harry was crying in great wretched sobs as Fawkes crooned over him.
   "Excellently done, Miss Granger. Do you know, not even I would have
   expected that to actually work?"

   The phoenix's song wasn't meant for her, Hermione knew, but she could
   still be soothed by it, which she needed, because her life was
   officially over.
