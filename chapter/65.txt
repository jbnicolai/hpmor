   Chapter 65: Contagious Lies

   Hermione Granger had read somewhere once, that one of the keys to
   staying thin was to pay attention to the food you ate, to notice
   yourself eating it, so that you were satisfied with the meal. This
   morning she'd made herself toast, and put butter on the toast, and
   cinnamon on the butter, and it really should've been enough to get her
   to notice, this time, the goodness that was in front of her...

   Without noticing the cinnamon or the butter, without noticing the food
   or that she was eating, Hermione swallowed another bite of toast, and
   said, "Can you try explaining that again? I'm still completely
   flabbergasted."

   "It's pretty straightforward, if you think like a Light-Side
   Slytherin," said the boy that everyone else in school, excepting only
   the two of them, now believed to be her true love. Harry Potter's spoon
   absentmindedly stirred his breakfast cereal; he hadn't taken many bites
   of it this morning, not that Hermione had seen. "Every good thing in
   the world brings its own opposition into existence. Phoenixes are no
   exception."

   Hermione took another unnoticed bite out of her buttered and cinnamoned
   toast, and said, "How can anyone not understand that Fawkes thinks
   you're a good enough person to ride around on your shoulder? He
   wouldn't do that with a Dark Wizard! He just wouldn't!"

   And she hadn't yelled at anyone about Fawkes's touch on her own cheek,
   because she knew it wouldn't be right - that if a phoenix touched you,
   you weren't supposed to brag about it, that wasn't what a phoenix was
   for.

   But she'd really hoped that it would squash the rumors about Harry
   Potter going evil and Hermione Granger following him down.

   And it hadn't.

   And she truly couldn't understand why not.

   Harry ate another bite of his cereal, his eyes going distant now, no
   longer meeting her own. "Think of it this way: You skip school one day,
   and you lie and tell your teacher you were sick. The teacher tells you
   to bring a doctor's note, so you forge one. The teacher says she's
   going to call the doctor to check, so you have to give her a fake
   number for the doctor, and get a friend to pretend to be the doctor
   when she calls -"

   "You did what?"

   Harry looked up from his cereal then, and now he was smiling. "I'm not
   saying I really did that, Hermione..." Then his eyes abruptly dropped
   back down to his cereal. "No. Just an example. Lies propagate, that's
   what I'm saying. You've got to tell more lies to cover them up, lie
   about every fact that's connected to the first lie. And if you kept on
   lying, and you kept on trying to cover it up, sooner or later you'd
   even have to start lying about the general laws of thought. Like,
   someone is selling you some kind of alternative medicine that doesn't
   work, and any double-blind experimental study will confirm that it
   doesn't work. So if someone wants to go on defending the lie, they've
   got to get you to disbelieve in the experimental method. Like, the
   experimental method is just for merely scientific kinds of medicine,
   not amazing alternative medicine like theirs. Or a good and virtuous
   person should believe as strongly as they can, no matter what the
   evidence says. Or truth doesn't exist and there's no such thing as
   objective reality. A lot of common wisdom like that isn't just
   mistaken, it's anti-epistemology, it's systematically wrong. Every rule
   of rationality that tells you how to find the truth, there's someone
   out there who needs you to believe the opposite. If you once tell a
   lie, the truth is ever after your enemy; and there's a lot of people
   out there telling lies -" Harry's voice stopped.

   "What does that have to do with Fawkes?" she said.

   Harry withdrew his spoon from his cereal, and pointed in the direction
   of the Head Table. "The Headmaster has a phoenix, right? And he's Chief
   Warlock of the Wizengamot? So he's got political opponents, like
   Lucius. Now, d'you think that opposition is going to just roll over and
   surrender, because Dumbledore has a phoenix and they don't? Do you
   think they'll admit that Fawkes is even evidence that Dumbledore's a
   good person? Of course not. They've got to invent something to say that
   makes Fawkes... not important. Like, phoenixes only follow people who
   charge straight at anyone they think is evil, so having a phoenix just
   means you're an idiot or a dangerous fanatic. Or, phoenixes just follow
   people who are pure Gryffindor, so Gryffindor they don't have the
   virtues of other Houses. Or it just shows how much courage a magical
   animal thinks you have, nothing else, and it wouldn't be fair to judge
   politicians based on that. They have to say something to deny the
   phoenix. I bet Lucius didn't even have to make up anything new. I bet
   it had all been said before, centuries ago, since the first time
   someone had a phoenix riding on his shoulder, and someone else wanted
   people not to take that into account as evidence. I bet by the time
   Fawkes came along it was already common wisdom, it would have just
   seemed strange to take into account who a phoenix liked or disliked. It
   would be like a Muggle newspaper testing political candidates to rate
   their level of scientific literacy. Every force for Good that exists in
   this universe, there's someone else who benefits from people
   discounting it, or fencing it into a narrow box where it can't get to
   them."

   "But -" Hermione said. "Okay, I see why Lucius Malfoy doesn't want
   anyone to think that Fawkes matters, but why does anyone who isn't a
   bad guy believe it?"

   Harry Potter gave a little shrug. His spoon dropped back into his
   cereal, and went on stirring without a pause. "Why does any kind of
   cynicism appeal to people? Because it seems like a mark of maturity, of
   sophistication, like you've seen everything and know better. Or because
   putting something down feels like pushing yourself up. Or they don't
   have a phoenix themselves, so their political instinct tells them
   there's no advantage to be gained from saying nice things about
   phoenixes. Or because being cynical feels like knowing a secret truth
   that common people don't know..." Harry Potter looked in the direction
   of the Head Table, and his voice dropped until it was almost a whisper.
   "I think maybe that's what he's getting wrong - that he's cynical about
   everything else, but not about cynicism itself."

   Without thinking, Hermione looked in the direction of the Head Table
   herself, but the Defense Professor's seat was still empty, as it had
   been on Monday and Tuesday; the Deputy Headmistress had pronounced,
   earlier, that Professor Quirrell's classes for today would be canceled.

   Afterward, when Harry had eaten a few bites of treacle tart and then
   left the table, Hermione looked at Anthony and Padma, who had been
   coincidentally eating nearby but certainly not eavesdropping or
   anything.

   Anthony and Padma looked back at her.

   Padma said hesitantly, "Is it just me, or has Harry Potter started
   talking like a more complicated sort of book in the last few days? I
   mean, I haven't been listening to him very long -"

   "It's not just you," said Anthony.

   Hermione didn't say anything, but she was becoming increasingly
   worried. Whatever had happened to Harry Potter on the day of the
   phoenix, it had changed him; there was something new in him now. Not
   cold, but hard. Sometimes she caught him staring out a window at
   nothing visible, a look of grim determination on his face. In Herbology
   class on Monday, a Venus Fire Trap had gone out of control; and Harry
   had tackled Terry out of the way of a fireball even as Professor Sprout
   had shouted a Flame-Freezing Charm; and when Harry had risen from the
   floor he'd just gone back to his place like nothing interesting had
   happened. And when for once she'd gotten a better test score than Harry
   in their Transfiguration exam, later that same Monday, Harry had smiled
   at her as though to congratulate her, instead of gritting his teeth;
   and... that had bothered her a lot.

   She was getting the sense that Harry...

   ...was pulling away from her...

   "He seems a lot older all of a sudden," said Anthony. "Not like a real
   grownup, I can't imagine Harry as a grownup, but it's like he suddenly
   turned into a fourth-year version of... of whatever he is."

   "Well," Padma said. She daintily dabbed a chocolate-flavored scone with
   some scone-flavored frosting. "I think Dragon and Sunshine had better
   ally during the next battle or Mr. Harry Potter is going to smash us.
   We were allied last time, and even then Chaos almost won -"

   "Yeah," said Anthony. "You're right, Miss Patil. Tell the Dragon
   General that we want to meet with you -"

   "No!" said Hermione. "We shouldn't have to gang up on General Potter
   just to stand a chance. That doesn't make sense, especially now that
   nobody can use Muggle things anymore. It's still twenty-four soldiers
   in every army."

   Neither Padma or Anthony said anything to that.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Knock-knock, knock-knock.

   "Come in, Mr. Potter," she said.

   The door creaked open, and Harry Potter slipped through the opening
   into her office; he pushed the door shut behind him with one hand, and
   wordlessly seated himself in the cushioned chair that now stood in
   front of her desk. She'd Transfigured that chair so often that it
   sometimes changed form to reflect her mood, without any wand movement
   or incantation or even conscious intent. Right now, that chair had
   become deeply cushioned, so that as Harry sat down he sank into it, as
   though the chair were hugging him.

   Harry didn't seem to notice. There was an air of quiet determination
   about the boy; his eyes had locked steadily with hers, and not let up
   for a moment. "You called me?" said the boy.

   "I did," said Professor McGonagall. "I have two pieces of good news for
   you, Mr. Potter. First - have you met Mr. Rubeus Hagrid, at all? The
   groundskeeper? He was an old friend of your parents."

   Harry hesitated. Then, "Mr. Hagrid spoke to me a bit after I got here,"
   Harry said. "I think it was on Tuesday of my first week of school. He
   didn't say he knew my parents, though. At the time I thought he just
   wanted to introduce himself to the Boy-Who-Lived... did he have some
   kind of hidden agenda? He didn't seem like the type..."

   "Ah..." she said. It took her a moment to pull her thoughts together.
   "It's a long story, Mr. Potter, but Mr. Hagrid was falsely accused of
   murdering a student, five decades ago. Mr. Hagrid's wand was snapped,
   and he was expelled. Later, when Professor Dumbledore became
   Headmaster, he gave Mr. Hagrid a place here as Keeper of Grounds and
   Keys."

   Harry's eyes watched her intently. "You said that five decades ago was
   the last time a student died in Hogwarts, and you were certain that
   five decades ago was the last time someone heard the Sorting Hat's
   secret message."

   She felt a slight chill - even the Headmaster or Severus might not have
   made that connection that quickly - and said, "Yes, Mr. Potter. Someone
   opened the Chamber of Secrets, but this was not believed, and Mr.
   Hagrid was blamed for the resulting death. However, the Headmaster has
   located the additional enchantment on the Sorting Hat, and he has shown
   it to a special panel of the Wizengamot. As a result, Mr. Hagrid's
   sentence has been revoked - just this morning, in fact - and he will be
   allowed to acquire a new wand." She hesitated. "We... have not yet told
   Mr. Hagrid of this, Mr. Potter. We were waiting until the deed was
   done, so as not to give him false hope after so long. Mr. Potter... we
   were wondering if we could tell Mr. Hagrid that it was you who helped
   him...?"

   She saw the weighing look in his eyes -

   "I remember Mr. Hagrid holding you when you were a baby," she said. "I
   think he would be very happy to know."

   She could see it, though, on Harry's face, the moment when he decided
   that Rubeus wouldn't be any use to him.

   Harry shook his head. "Bad enough that someone might deduce there was a
   Parselmouth in this year's crop of students," Harry said. "I think it'd
   be more prudent to just keep it all as secret as possible."

   She remembered James and Lily, who'd never hesitated to return the
   friendship the huge, bluff man had offered them, for all that James was
   the scion of a wealthy House or Lily a budding Charms Mistress, and
   Rubeus a mere half-giant whose wand had been snapped...

   "Because you don't expect him to prove useful, Mr. Potter?"

   There was silence. She hadn't intended to say that out loud.

   Sadness crossed Harry's face. "Probably," Harry said quietly. "But I
   don't think he and I would get along, do you?"

   Something seemed to be stuck in her throat.

   "Speaking of making use of people," Harry said. "It seems I'm going to
   be thrown into a war with a Dark Lord sometime soon. So while I'm in
   your office, I'd like to ask that my sleep cycle be extended to thirty
   hours per day. Neville Longbottom wants to start practicing dueling,
   there's an older Hufflepuff who offered to teach him, and they invited
   me to join. Plus there's other things I want to learn too - and if you
   or the Headmaster think I should study anything in particular, in order
   to become a powerful wizard when I grow up, let me know. Please direct
   Madam Pomfrey to administer the appropriate potion, or whatever it is
   that she needs to do -"

   "Mr. Potter!"

   Harry's eyes gazed directly into her own. "Yes, Minerva? I know it
   wasn't your idea, but I'd like to survive the use the Headmaster's
   making of me. Please don't be an obstacle to that."

   It almost broke her. "Harry," she whispered in a bare voice, "children
   shouldn't have to think like that!"

   "You're right, they shouldn't," Harry said. "A lot of children have to
   grow up too early, though, not just me; and most children like that
   would probably trade places with me in five seconds. I'm not going to
   pity myself, Professor McGonagall, not when there are people out there
   in real trouble and I'm not one of them."

   She swallowed, hard, and said, "Mr. Potter, at thirty hours per day,
   you'll - get older, you'll age faster -" Like Albus.

   "And in my fifth year I'll be around the same physiological age as
   Hermione," said Harry. "Doesn't seem that terrible." There was a wry
   smile now on Harry's face. "Honestly, I'd probably want this even if
   there weren't a Dark Lord. Wizards live for a while, and either wizards
   or Muggles will probably push that out even further over the next
   century. There's no reason not to pack as many hours into a day as I
   can. I've got things I plan to do, and 'twere well they were done
   quickly."

   There was a long pause.

   "All right," Minerva said. It came out as almost a whisper. She raised
   her voice. "All right, Mr. Potter, I shall ask the Headmaster, and if
   he agrees, it shall be done."

   Harry's eyes narrowed for a moment. "I see. Then please remind the
   Headmaster that Godric Gryffindor, in his last words, said that if it
   had been the right thing for him to do, then he wouldn't tell anyone
   else to choose wrongly, not even the youngest student in Hogwarts."

   And she knew with a hollow feeling that any chance of Albus stopping
   this, stopping any of this, had just Vanished into nothingness. That
   was what Albus had told her when she'd objected that Cameron Edward was
   too young, and then when she'd objected that Peter Pevensie was too
   young, and finally she'd given up objecting. "Who told you that, Mr.
   Potter?" Not Albus - surely Albus would never say that to any student -

   "I've been doing a lot of reading lately," Harry said. His body started
   to rise from the enveloping chair, then halted. "Dare I ask about the
   second piece of good news?"

   "Oh," she said. "Ah - Professor Quirrell has woken up and says that you
   may -"
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Hogwarts infirmary was a brilliantly open space, skylit on all four
   sides despite seeming to be located squarely in the middle of the
   castle. White beds in long rows stretched out, only three of them
   occupied at the moment. One older boy and one older girl on opposite
   sides, both lying motionless with their eyes closed, probably
   unconscious and spell-bound while some healing Charm or Potion
   reconfigured their bodies in uncomfortable ways; and the third occupant
   had the curtain drawn around their bed, which was presumably a good
   thing. Madam Pomfrey had pushed him along with a hard shove and told
   him not to gawk, and Harry had needed to remind himself sharply that
   some people still didn't know who the Boy-Who-Lived was - either that,
   or Madam Pomfrey's identity was bound up with her absolute dominance of
   her own hospital, etcetera, whatever.

   Behind the rows of beds were five doors, leading into the private rooms
   where they stored the patients who would be staying for days instead of
   hours, but whose condition didn't warrant a transfer to St. Mungos.

   Windowless, skyless, unlit but for a single smokeless torch on one of
   the solid stone walls; that was the room behind the middle door. Harry
   had wondered whether professors could ask Hogwarts to change itself; or
   if the infirmary always had a room like that available, for people who
   didn't enjoy the light.

   In the center of the room, between two equal bedstands that looked to
   have been carved from the same grey marble as the walls, rested a white
   hospital bed, looking vaguely orangish in the unsmoking torchlight; and
   within that bed, a white sheet pulled up about his thighs and wearing a
   hospital gown, sat Professor Quirrell with his back slightly propped up
   against the headboard of the bed.

   There was something frightening about seeing Professor Quirrell in one
   of Madam Pomfrey's beds, even if the Defense Professor appeared
   uninjured. Even knowing that Professor Quirrell had deliberately
   arranged his own apparent defeat at Severus's hands, to give himself an
   excuse to recover his strength from Azkaban. Harry had never actually
   watched anyone dying in a hospital bed, but he'd seen too many movies.
   It was an intimation of mortality, and the Defense Professor was not
   supposed to be mortal.

   Madam Pomfrey had told Harry that he was absolutely forbidden to pester
   her patient.

   Harry had said, "I understand", which technically did not say anything
   about obedience.

   The stern old healer had then turned, and started to say to Professor
   Quirrell that he was absolutely not to overexert himself or... upset
   himself...

   Madam Pomfrey had trailed off, hurriedly turned around, and fled the
   room.

   "Not bad," Harry observed, after the door had shut behind the escaping
   medical matron. "I've got to learn how to do that, sometime."

   Professor Quirrell smiled a smile with absolutely no humor content, and
   said, his voice sounding a good deal dryer than its usual dryness,
   "Thank you for your artistic critique, Mr. Potter."

   Harry stared into the pale blue eyes, and thought that Professor
   Quirrell looked...

   ...older.

   It was subtle, it might have just been Harry's imagination, it might
   have been the poor lighting. But the hair above Quirinus Quirrell's
   forehead might have receded a bit, what remained might have thinned and
   greyed, an advancing of the baldness that had already been visible on
   the back of his head. The face might have grown a little sunken.

   The pale blue eyes had stayed sharp and intense.

   "I am glad," Harry said quietly, "to see you in what appears to be good
   health."

   "Appearances can be deceiving, of course," said Professor Quirrell. He
   gave a flick of his fingers, and when his hand finished the gesture he
   was holding his wand. "Would you believe that woman thinks she has
   confiscated this from me?"

   Six incantations the Defense Professor spoke then; six of the thirty
   that he had used to safeguard their important conversations in Mary's
   Room.

   Harry raised his eyebrows, silently quizzical.

   "That is all I can manage for now," said the Defense Professor. "I
   expect it shall prove sufficient. Still, there is a proverb: If you do
   not wish a thing heard, do not say it. Consider it to apply in full
   measure. I am told that you were trying to see me?"

   "Yes," Harry said. He paused, gathered his thoughts. "Did the
   Headmaster, or anyone, tell you that we can't go to lunch any more?"

   "Something along those lines," said the Defense Professor. And without
   changing expression, "Of course I was terribly sorry to hear it."

   "It's more extreme than that, actually," said Harry. "I'm confined to
   Hogwarts and its grounds indefinitely. I can't leave without a guard
   and a good reason. I'm not going home for summer, and maybe not ever
   again. I was hoping... to speak with you, about that."

   There was a pause.

   The Defense Professor exhaled a breath like a brief sigh, and said, "We
   shall just have to rely on the known fact that the Deputy Headmistress
   will personally murder anyone who tries to report me. Mr. Potter, I
   intend to keep this conversation on track so that we may conclude it
   quickly, is that understood?"

   Harry nodded, and -

   In the light of the single torch, shaded toward the reddish end of the
   optical spectrum, the snake's green scales were not very reflective,
   and the blue-and-white banding hardly more so. Dark seemed the snake,
   in that light. The eyes, which had seemed like gray pits before, now
   reflected the torchlight, and seemed brighter than the rest of the
   snake.

   "Sso," hissed the venomous creature. "What did you wissh to ssay?"

   And Harry hissed, "Sschoolmasster thinkss that woman'ss former Lord iss
   the one who sstole her from prisson."

   Harry had thought about it this time, and carefully, before he had
   decided that he would reveal to Professor Quirrell only that the
   Headmaster believed that; and not say anything about the prophecy which
   had set Voldemort on Harry's parents, nor that the Headmaster was
   reconstituting the Order of the Phoenix... it was a risk, a significant
   risk, but Harry needed an ally in this.

   "He believess that one iss alive?" the snake finally said. The divided,
   two-pronged tongue flickered rapidly from side to side, sardonic
   snakish laughter. "Ssomehow I am not ssurprissed."

   "Yess," Harry hissed dryly, "very amussing, I am ssure. Except now am
   sstuck in Hogwartss for next ssix years, for ssafety! I have decided
   that I will, indeed, sseek power; and confinement iss not helpful for
   that. Musst convince sschoolmasster that Dark Lord iss not yet
   awakened, that esscape was work of ssome other power -"

   Again the rapid flickering of the snake's tongue; the snakish laughter
   was stronger, dryer, this time. "Amateur foolisshnesss."

   "Pardon?" hissed Harry.

   "You ssee misstake, think of undoing, ssetting time back to sstart. Yet
   not even with hourglasss can time be undone. Musst move forward
   insstead. You think of convincing otherss they are misstaken. Far
   eassier to convince them they are right. Sso conssider, boy: what new
   happensstance would make schoolmasster decide you were ssafe once more,
   ssimultaneoussly advance your other agendass?"

   Harry stared at the snake, puzzled. His mind tried to comprehend and
   unravel the riddle -

   "Iss it not obviouss?" hissed the snake. Again the tongue flickered
   sardonic laughter. "To free yoursself, to gain power in Britain, you
   musst again be sseen to defeat the Dark Lord."
     __________________________________________________________________

   In reddish-orange flickering torchlight, a green snake swayed above a
   white hospital bed, as the boy stared into the embers of its eyes.

   "Sso," Harry said finally. "Let uss be clear on what iss propossed. You
   ssuggesst that we sset up imposstor to imperssonate Dark Lord."

   "Ssomething like that. Woman we resscued will cooperate, sshould be
   mosst convincing when sshe iss sseen at hiss sside." More sardonic
   tongue-flickering. "You are kidnapped from Hogwartss to public
   location, many witnesssess, wardss keep out protectorss. Dark Lord
   announcess that he hass at long lasst regained physical form, after
   wandering as sspirit for yearss; ssayss that he hass gained sstill
   greater power, not even you can sstop him now. Offerss to let you duel.
   You casst guardian Charm, Dark Lord laughss at you, ssayss he iss not
   life-eater. Casstss Killing Cursse at you, you block, watcherss ssee
   Dark Lord explode -"

   "Casst Killing Cursse?" Harry hissed in incredulity. "At me? Again?
   Ssecond time? Nobody will believe Dark Lord could posssibly be that
   sstupid -"

   "You and I are only two people in country who would notice that,"
   hissed the snake. "Trusst me on thiss, boy."

   "What if there iss third, ssomeday?"

   The snake swayed thoughtfully. "Could write different sscript for play,
   if you wissh. Whatever sscenario, sshould leave open posssibility Dark
   Lord might return yet again - nation musst think they are sstill
   dependent on you to protect them."

   Harry stared into the red-flickering pits of the snake's eyes.

   "Well?" hissed the swaying form.

   The obvious thought was that going along with the Defense Professor's
   plots and deceptions a second time, spinning an even more complicated
   lie to cover up the first mistake, and creating another fatal
   vulnerability if anyone ever discovered the truth, would be exactly the
   same sort of stupidity as the putative Dark Lord using the Killing
   Curse again. It didn't even take his Hufflepuff side to point that out,
   Harry thought it in his very own mental voice.

   But there was also a certain question as to whether the appropriate
   moral to learn from the last experience was to always say no
   immediately to the Defense Professor, or...

   "Will think about it," hissed Harry. "Will not ansswer right away,
   thiss time, will enumerate risskss and benefitss firsst -"

   "Undersstood," hissed the snake. "But remember thiss, boy, other
   eventss proceed without you. Hessitation iss alwayss eassy, rarely
   usseful."
     __________________________________________________________________

   The boy emerged from the private room into the main infirmary, running
   nervous fingers through his messy black hair as he walked past the
   white beds, occupied and unoccupied.

   Shortly afterward, the boy emerged from the Hogwarts infirmary
   entirely, passing Madam Pomfrey on the way out with a distracted nod.

   The boy walked out into a hallway, then into a larger corridor, and
   then stopped and leaned against the wall.

   The thing was...

   ...he really didn't want to be stuck in Hogwarts for the next six
   years; and when you thought about it...

   ... the Incident with Rescuing Bellatrix From Azkaban wasn't just
   imposing costs on Harry. Other people would be worrying, living in fear
   of the Dark Lord's return, expending unknown resources to take unknown
   precautions. Harry could demand that they write the script in such
   fashion as to make it seem not plausible that the Dark Lord would
   return a third time. And then people would relax, it would all be over.

   Unless of course there actually was a Dark Lord out there to be feared.
   There had been a prophecy.

   The boy leaning against the wall vented a soft sigh, and started
   walking again.

   Harry had almost forgotten, but he had gotten around to showing
   Professor Quirrell the deck of cards he'd been given on Sunday night by
   'Santa Claus', within which the King of Hearts was allegedly a portkey
   that would take him to the Salem Witches' Institute in America.
   Although of course Harry hadn't told Professor Quirrell who'd sent him
   the card, nor what it was supposed to do, before he'd asked Professor
   Quirrell if it was possible to tell where the portkey would send him.

   The Defense Professor had transformed back to human form, and examined
   the King of Hearts, tapping it a few times with his wand.

   And according to Professor Quirrell...

   ...the portkey would send the user somewhere in London, but he couldn't
   pinpoint it any nearer than that.

   Harry had shown Professor Quirrell the note that had accompanied the
   deck of cards, saying nothing of the earlier notes.

   Professor Quirrell had taken it in at a glance, given a dry chuckle,
   and observed that if you read the note carefully, it did not explicitly
   say that the portkey would take him to the Salem Witches' Institute.

   You needed to learn to pay attention to that kind of subtlety,
   Professor Quirrell said, if you wanted to be a powerful wizard when you
