   Chapter 64: Omake Files 4, Alternate Parallels

   If you're five hours past your bedtime and still reading this, may I
   suggest getting some sleep? The fic will still be here tomorrow...
   unless, you know, something bad happens to it and the next morning
   there's just a 404 at this address and you're left with nothing but a
   fading memory and an eternal regret that you didn't stay awake longer
   and keep reading while you still had the chance... but hey, how
   probable is that?

   This story spreads by blogging, tweeting, word of mouth, favoriting,
   plugging on forums, and adding to lists; and remember, if the readers
   before you hadn't taken a moment to do that, you probably wouldn't have
   found this. If that's not enough to motivate you, then let me add that
   if you don't help spread rationality, Hermione will be sad. You don't
   want her to be sad, right?

   Don't forget to visit LessWrong dot com and read the Sequences, the
   true existence of which this fic is but a shadow. I recommend starting
   with the sequence How to Actually Change Your Mind.

   And now, with all universes owned by their respective creators, I
   present:

   LORD OF THE RATIONALITY

   Frodo glanced at all the faces, but they were not turned to him. All
   the Council sat with downcast eyes, as if in deep thought. A great
   dread fell on him, as if he was awaiting the pronouncement of some doom
   that he had long foreseen and vainly hoped might after all never be
   spoken. An overwhelming longing to rest and remain at peace by Bilbo's
   side in Rivendell filled all his heart. At last with an effort he
   spoke, and wondered to hear his own words, as if some other will was
   using his small voice.

   "We cannot," said Frodo. "We must not. Do you not see? It is exactly
   what the Enemy desires. All of this he has foreseen."

   The faces turned to him, puzzled the Dwarves and grave the Elves;
   sternness in the eyes of the Men; and so keen the gazes of Elrond and
   of Gandalf that Frodo almost could not withstand it. It was very hard,
   then, not to grasp the Ring in his hand, and harder still not to put it
   on, to face them as only Frodo.

   "Do you not question it?" Frodo said, thin like the wind his voice, and
   wavering like a breeze. "You have chosen, of all things, to send the
   Ring into Mordor; should you not wonder? How did it come to this? That
   we might, of all our choices, do that single thing our Enemy most
   desires? Perhaps the Cracks of Doom are already guarded, strongly
   enough to hold off Gandalf and Elrond and Glorfindel all together; or
   perhaps the Master of that place has cooled the lava there, set it to
   trap the Ring so that he may simply bring it out after it is thrown
   in..." A memory of awful clarity came over Frodo then, and a flash of
   black laughter, and the thought came to him that it was just what the
   Enemy would do. Only the thought came to him so: thus it would amuse me
   to do, if I meant to rule...
