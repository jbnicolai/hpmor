   Ahem.

   The third-generation quarks were also called "truth" and "beauty"
   before "top" and "bottom" won out; my birthdate is around Hermione's,
   and when I was eleven, I used "truth" and "beauty".

   When Part I of this chapter was first posted, I said that if anyone
   guessed what the last sentence was talking about before the next
   update, I would tell them the entire rest of the plot.

   "Abbott, Hannah!"

   Pause.

   "HUFFLEPUFF!"

   "Bones, Susan!"

   Pause.

   "HUFFLEPUFF!"

   "Boot, Terry!"

   Pause.

   "RAVENCLAW!"

   Harry glanced over briefly at his new House-mate, more to get a quick
   look at the face than anything else. He was still trying to get himself
   under control from his encounter with the ghosts. The sad, the really
   sad, the really truly sad thing was that he did seem to be getting
   himself under control again. It seemed ill-fitting. Like he should have
   taken at least a day. Maybe a whole lifetime. Maybe just never.

   "Corner, Michael!"

   Long pause.

   "RAVENCLAW!"

   At the lectern before the huge Head Table stood Professor McGonagall,
   looking sharp and looking sharply around, as she called out one name
   after another, though she had smiled only for Hermione and a few
   others. Behind her, in the tallest chair at the table - really more of
   a golden throne - sat a wizened and bespectacled ancient, with a
   silver-white beard that looked like it would go almost to the floor if
   it were visible, watching over the Sorting with a benevolent
   expression; as stereotypical in appearance as a Wise Old Man could
   possibly be, without actually being Oriental. (Though Harry had learned
   to be wary of stereotypical appearances from the first time he'd met
   Professor McGonagall and thought that she ought to cackle.) The ancient
   wizard had applauded every student Sorted, with an unwavering smile
   that somehow seemed freshly delighted for each.

   To the golden throne's left side was a man with sharp eyes and a dour
   face who had applauded no-one, and who somehow managed to be looking
   straight back at Harry every time Harry looked at him. Further to the
   left, the pale-faced man Harry had seen in the Leaky Cauldron, whose
   eyes darted around as though in panic at the surrounding crowd, and who
   seemed to occasionally jerk and twitch in his seat; for some reason
   Harry kept finding himself staring at him. To that man's left, a string
   of three older witches who didn't seem much interested in the students.
   Then to the right side of the tall golden chair, a round-faced
   middle-aged witch with a yellow hat, who had applauded every student
   except the Slytherins. A tiny man standing on his chair, with a poofy
   white beard, who had applauded every student, but smiled only upon the
   Ravenclaws. And on the farthest right, occupying the same space as
   three lesser beings, the mountainous entity who'd greeted them all
   after they'd disembarked from the train, naming himself Hagrid, Keeper
   of Keys and Grounds.

   "Is the man standing on his chair the Head of Ravenclaw?" Harry
   whispered towards Hermione.

   For once Hermione didn't answer this instantly; she was shifting
   constantly from side to side, staring at the Sorting Hat, and fidgeting
   so energetically that Harry thought her feet might be leaving the
   floor.

   "Yes, he is," said one of the prefects who'd accompanied them, a young
   woman wearing the blue of Ravenclaw. Miss Clearwater, if Harry recalled
   correctly. Her voice was quiet, but conveyed a tinge of pride. "That is
   the Charms Professor of Hogwarts, Filius Flitwick, the most
   knowledgeable Charms Master alive, and a past Duelling Champion -"

   "Why's he so short?" hissed a student whose name Harry didn't recall.
   "Is he a halfbreed?"

   A chill glance from the young lady prefect. "The Professor does indeed
   have goblin ancestry -"

   "What?" Harry said involuntarily, causing Hermione and four other
   students to hush him.

   Now Harry was getting a surprisingly intimidating glare from the
   Ravenclaw prefect.

   "I mean -" Harry whispered. "Not that I have a problem with that - it's
   just - I mean - how's that possible? You can't just mix two different
   species together and get viable offspring! It ought to scramble the
   genetic instructions for every organ that's different between the two
   species - it'd be like trying to build," they didn't have cars so he
   couldn't use a scrambled-engine-blueprints analogy, "a half-carriage
   half-boat or something..."

   The Ravenclaw prefect was still looking at Harry severely. "Why
   couldn't you have a half-carriage half-boat?"

   "Hssh!" hsshed another prefect, though the Ravenclaw witch had still
   spoken quietly.

   "I mean -" Harry said even more quietly, trying to figure out how to
   ask whether goblins had evolved from humans, or evolved from a common
   ancestor of humans like Homo erectus, or if goblins had been made out
   of humans somehow - if, say, they were still genetically human under a
   heritable enchantment whose magical effect was diluted if only one
   parent was a 'goblin', which would explain how interbreeding was
   possible, and in which case goblins would not be an incredibly valuable
   second data point for how intelligence had evolved in other species
   besides Homo sapiens - now that Harry thought about it, the goblins in
   Gringotts hadn't seemed very much like genuinely alien, nonhuman
   intelligences, nothing like Dirdir or Puppeteers - "I mean, where did
   goblins come from, anyway?"

   "Lithuania," Hermione whispered absently, her eyes still fixed firmly
   on the Sorting Hat.

   Now Hermione was getting a smile from the lady prefect.

   "Never mind," whispered Harry.

   At the lectern, Professor McGonagall called out, "Goldstein, Anthony!"

   "RAVENCLAW!"

   Hermione, next to Harry, was bouncing on her tiptoes so hard that her
   feet were actually leaving the ground on each bounce.

   "Goyle, Gregory!"

   There was a long, tense moment of silence under the Hat. Almost a
   minute.

   "SLYTHERIN!"

   "Granger, Hermione!"

   Hermione broke loose and ran full tilt towards the Sorting Hat, picked
   it up and jammed the patchy old clothwork down hard over her head,
   making Harry wince. Hermione had been the one to explain to him about
   the Sorting Hat, but she certainly didn't treat it like an
   irreplaceable, vitally important, 800-year-old artefact of forgotten
   magic that was about to perform intricate telepathy on her mind and
   didn't seem to be in very good physical condition.

   "RAVENCLAW!"

   And talk about your foregone conclusions. Harry didn't see why Hermione
   had been so tense about it. In what weird alternative universe would
   that girl not be Sorted into Ravenclaw? If Hermione Granger didn't go
   to Ravenclaw then there was no good reason for Ravenclaw House to
   exist.

   Hermione arrived at the Ravenclaw table and got a dutiful cheer; Harry
   wondered whether the cheer would have been louder, or quieter, if
   they'd had any idea just what level of competition they'd welcomed to
   their table. Harry knew pi to 3.141592 because accuracy to one part in
   a million was enough for most practical purposes. Hermione knew one
   hundred digits of pi because that was how many digits had been printed
   in the back of her maths textbook.

   Neville Longbottom went to Hufflepuff, Harry was glad to see. If that
   House really did contain the loyalty and camaraderie it was supposed to
   exemplify, then a Houseful of reliable friends would do Neville a whole
   world of good. Clever kids in Ravenclaw, evil kids in Slytherin,
   wannabe heroes in Gryffindor, and everyone who does the actual work in
   Hufflepuff.

   (Though Harry had been right to consult a Ravenclaw prefect first. The
   young woman hadn't even looked up from her reading or identified Harry,
   just jabbed a wand in Neville's direction and muttered something. After
   which Neville had acquired a dazed expression and wandered off to the
   fifth carriage from the front and the fourth compartment on the left,
   which indeed had contained his toad.)

   "Malfoy, Draco!" went to Slytherin, and Harry breathed a small sigh of
   relief. It had seemed like a sure thing, but you never did know what
   tiny event might upset the course of your master plan.

   Professor McGonagall called "Perks, Sally-Anne!", and from the gathered
   children detached a pale waifish girl who looked oddly ethereal - like
   she might mysteriously disappear the moment you stopped looking at her,
   and never be seen again or even remembered.

   And then (with a note of trepidation so firmly kept from her voice and
   face that you'd have needed to know her very well indeed to notice)
   Minerva McGonagall inhaled deeply, and called out, "Potter, Harry!"

   There was a sudden silence in the hall.

   All conversation stopped.

   All eyes turned to stare.

   For the first time in his entire life, Harry felt like he might be
   having an opportunity to experience stage fright.

   Harry immediately stomped down this feeling. Whole room-fulls of people
   staring at him was something he'd have to accustom himself to, if he
   wanted to live in magical Britain, or for that matter do anything else
   interesting with his life. Affixing a confident and false smile to his
   face, he raised a foot to step forwards -

   "Harry Potter!" cried the voice of either Fred or George Weasley, and
   then "Harry Potter!" cried the other Weasley twin, and a moment later
   the entire Gryffindor table, and soon after a good portion of Ravenclaw
   and Hufflepuff, had taken up the cry.

   "Harry Potter! Harry Potter! Harry Potter!"

   And Harry Potter walked forwards. Much too slowly, he realized once
   he'd begun, but by then it was too late to alter his pace without it
   looking awkward.
     __________________________________________________________________

   "Harry Potter! Harry Potter! HARRY POTTER!"

   With all too good a notion of what she would see, Minerva McGonagall
   turned to look behind herself at the rest of the Head Table.

   Trelawney frantically fanning herself, Filius looking on with
   curiosity, Hagrid clapping along, Sprout looking severe, Vector and
   Sinistra bemused, and Quirrell gazing vacuously at nothing. Albus
   smiling benevolently. And Severus Snape gripping his empty wine goblet,
   white-knuckled, so hard that the silver was slowly deforming.

   With a wide grin, turning his head to bow to one side and then the
   other as he walked between the four House tables, Harry Potter walked
   forwards at a grandly measured pace, a prince inheriting his castle.

   "Save us from some more Dark Lords!" called one of the Weasley twins,
   and then the other Weasley twin cried, "Especially if they're
   Professors!" to general laughter from all the tables except Slytherin.

   Minerva's lips set in a white line. She would have words with the
   Weasley Horrors about that last part, if they thought she was powerless
   because it was the first day of school and Gryffindor had no points to
   take away. If they didn't care about detentions then she would find
   something else.

   Then, with a sudden gasp of horror, she looked in Severus's direction,
   surely he realized the Potter boy must have no idea who that was
   talking about -

   Severus's face had gone beyond rage into a kind of pleasant
   indifference. A faint smile played about his lips. He was looking in
   the direction of Harry Potter, not the Gryffindor table, and his hands
   held the crumpled remains of a former wine goblet.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Harry Potter walked forwards with a fixed smile, feeling warm inside
   and sort of awful at the same time.

   They were cheering him for a job he'd done when he was one year old. A
   job he hadn't really finished. Somewhere, somehow, the Dark Lord was
   still alive. Would they have been cheering quite so hard, if they knew
   that?

   But the Dark Lord's power had been broken once.

   And Harry would protect them again. If there was in fact a prophecy and
   that was what it said. Well, actually regardless of what any darn
   prophecy said.

   All those people believing in him and cheering him - Harry couldn't
   stand to let that be false. To flash and fade like so many other child
   prodigies. To be a disappointment. To fail to live up to his reputation
   as a symbol of the Light, never mind how he'd gotten it. He would
   absolutely, positively, no matter how long it took and even if it
   killed him, fulfill their expectations. And then go on to exceed those
   expectations, so that people wondered, looking back, that they had once
   asked so little of him.

   "HARRY POTTER! HARRY POTTER! HARRY POTTER!"

   Harry took his last steps towards the Sorting Hat. He swept a bow to
   the Order of Chaos at the Gryffindor table, and then turned and swept
   another bow to the other side of the hall, and waited for the applause
   and giggling to die away.

   (In the back of his mind, he wondered if the Sorting Hat was genuinely
   conscious in the sense of being aware of its own awareness, and if so,
   whether it was satisfied with only getting to talk to eleven-year-olds
   once per year. Its song had implied so: Oh, I'm the Sorting Hat and I'm
   okay, I sleep all year and I work one day...)

   When there was once more silence in the room, Harry sat on the stool
   and carefully placed onto his head the 800-year-old telepathic artefact
   of forgotten magic.

   Thinking, just as hard as he could: Don't Sort me yet! I have questions
   I need to ask you! Have I ever been Obliviated? Did you Sort the Dark
   Lord when he was a child and can you tell me about his weaknesses? Can
   you tell me why I got the brother wand to the Dark Lord's? Is the Dark
   Lord's ghost bound to my scar and is that why I get so angry sometimes?
   Those are the most important questions, but if you've got another
   moment can you tell me anything about how to rediscover the lost magics
   that created you?

   Into the silence of Harry's spirit, where before there had never been
   any voice but one, there came a second and unfamiliar voice, sounding
   distinctly worried:

   "Oh, dear. This has never happened before..."
