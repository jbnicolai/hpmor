   Chapter 83: Taboo Tradeoffs, Aftermath 1

   When Padma entered the Transfiguration classroom, she saw that half the
   class had beaten her there, a strange, deathly silence pervading the
   room. Harry Potter sat alone in one corner, staring off into some
   unknown distance, his eyes half-lidded, nearly closed.

   Rumor said that the Aurors had discovered that the Defense Professor
   had Polyjuiced as Granger to fool Malfoy.

   Rumor said that Hermione had been bound by the Unbreakable Vow to be
   Draco Malfoy's slave.

   Rumor said that Hermione had gotten the Dementor's Kiss.

   But if that were true, Harry Potter wouldn't be sitting there, he would
   be -

   Padma didn't know what General Potter would do. Her mind went blank,
   trying to think about it.

   Even when Professor McGonagall got there, the silence hadn't broken.
   The Transfiguration Professor walked up to the board without a pause,
   erased it with a sweep of her hand, and then began to write.

   "Today, children," began the calm professional voice of the
   Transfiguration Professor, just as though nothing out of the ordinary
   had happened that week, "we shall learn how much effort it takes to
   sustain a Transfiguration, and why, at your age, you should not even
   try. The original Form is not gone, only suppressed; and to maintain
   that suppression -"

   "Excuse me," said Padma Patil. She knew her voice was shaking, she knew
   that she was trembling visibly, but she had to ask. "Excuse me,
   Professor, what happened with Miss Granger?"

   The Transfiguration Professor paused at the board, and turned to look
   at Padma. The Professor should have looked stern, having been
   interrupted without a hand being raised, but instead her face was
   kindly. "You don't already know, Miss Patil? I expected that rumor
   would have spread."

   "There's too many rumors," said Padma. "I don't know what's true."

   Morag MacDougal raised her hand, then said without waiting to be
   called, "I told you, Padma, what's true is that the Wizengamot found
   Granger guilty and ordered her to get the Dementor's Kiss and they
   brought in the Dementor and Harry Potter glued it to the ceiling and
   wouldn't let it down until -"

   "Oh, dear Merlin," said Professor McGonagall, her expression growing
   sharp, but then she visibly calmed herself. "The affair was utterly
   ridiculous and I shan't go into detail. Let it stand that Miss Granger
   is resting with Madam Pomfrey for now, and coming back to classes
   tomorrow. And if I catch anyone bothering her, I shall turn them into
   glass vases and drop them."

   The entire class gasped at this; it wasn't so much that the threat was
   fatal, as that it broke the safety rules for Transfiguration.

   Professor McGonagall turned back to her board -

   From a corner of the classroom, another voice rose up. "What about
   Professor Quirrell?" said Terry Boot. "Has he been arrested?"

   "The Aurors are only detaining him," said the Transfiguration Professor
   without turning around. "If they have not given back our Defense
   Professor by tomorrow, I shall ask the Headmaster to go fetch him.
   Though I may as well tell you now that the Board of Governors has
   scheduled a vote on whether Professor Quirrell's battles shall be
   allowed to continue."

   Kevin Entwhistle spoke. "And General Malfoy? When's he getting back
   from St. Mungo's?"

   The Transfiguration Professor paused in her drawing.

   She turned around again, more slowly, this time.

   "I am sorry, Mr. Entwhistle," said Professor McGonagall. Her face
   looked a little more lined than when she had entered the room. "Mr.
   Malfoy's health is in no danger, I am given to understand.
   Unfortunately, I have received an owl from Mr. Malfoy's father
   withdrawing him from Hogwarts. I am afraid he is not coming back."
